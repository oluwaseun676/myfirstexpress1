                little Lemon is a restaurant under us where 
                The chefs draw inspiration from Italian, Greek, and Turkish culture
                and have a menu of 12-15 items that they rotate seasonally.
              </p>
      
              <p>
                The restaurant has a rustic and relaxed atmosphere with moderate
                prices, making it a popular place for a meal any time of the day.

                Little Lemon is owned by two Italian brothers, Mario and Adrian, who
                moved to the United States to pursue their shared dream of owning a
                restaurant.
              </p>
      
              <p>
                To craft the menu, Mario relies on family recipes and his experience
                as a chef in Italy.
              </p>
      
              <p>
                Adrian does all the marketing for the restaurant and led the effort to
                expand the menu beyond classic Italian to incorporate additional
                cuisines from the mediterranean region.
